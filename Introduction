Introduction
The housing market in Toronto is increasing day by day and many people consider buying a 
new house as an investment. Many second-home buyers intend to rent their new property and 
renting to university/college students might be very profitable. However, if the intention 
of the buyer is to rent to young people then it is fundamental to pick a location that provides 
different amenities and in a walking distance as grocery stores, pharmacies, fast food and entertainments.
In this project we intend to provide a potential buyer different locations in Toronto where he/she can 
invest his/her money. In order to do that, we will use all the available information that can be found through Foursquare.
